{"name":"Mic-meter","tagline":"Microbenchmarks for Xeon Phi","body":"### Introduction\r\nBased on Intelâ€™s Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture, Intel Xeon Phi is one of the few truly many-core CPUs - featuring around 60 fairly powerful cores, two levels of caches, and graphic memory, all interconnected by a very fast ring. Given its promised ease-of-use and high performance, we took Xeon Phi out for a test drive. Specifically, we present a suite of microbenchmarks, and show the high performance of five components of the architecture, focusing on their maximum achieved performance and the prerequisites to achieve it.\r\n\r\n### SCAT View of Xeon Phi\r\n\r\n![SCAT Model](http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/pds/homepages/fang/docs/mic_view3.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\nJ.
